            <img src="images/pets/cody.jpg" width="400" alt="corgi sitting on wood floor">
            <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.</p>
            <p>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</p>

            <h2>Juno</h2>
            <img src="images/pets/juno.jpg" width="400" alt="A black and brown dog laying on a wood floor">
            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size, hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.</p>
            <p>One of Junoâ€™s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.</p>

            <img src="images/pets/sprout.jpg" width="400" alt="brown and grey, short-haired tabby cat, with white paws, laying on side on an office chair.">
            <p>Sprout, a shy and elusive kitten when he first arrived at four months old, gradually became an affectionate companion. He enjoyed sleeping on my bed, but his early morning wake-up calls at 6:30 AM were a daily routine.</p>
            <p>During Kai's challenging academic phase, Sprout became their constant companion during late-night drawing sessions, quietly curling up on their lap, providing comfort and banishing solitude.</p>
